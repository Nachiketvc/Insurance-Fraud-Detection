My academic project Insurance Fraud Detection. The dataset is from Kaggle. The dataset was semi structured with 25000 entries. The goal of this project was to identify fraudulent claims in insurance datasets. What is Insurance Fraud - Insurance fraud is when people lie to an insurance company to get money they donâ€™t deserve. Insurance Fraud Detection is the process of finding these false claims to stop fraud and save money.
I performed data preprocessing, including handling missing values and feature selection. I then applied various machine learning algorithms, such as Decision Trees,  Random Forests, XGBoost and neural network, to classify claims as either fraudulent or genuine and the unique. 
The best performing  model was XGBoost with maximum number of accuracy and F1- Score and then I have used Hybridisation Technique on the XGBoost and Random Forest Model.
